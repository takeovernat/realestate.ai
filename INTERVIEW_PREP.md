## üéØ Technical Talking Points

### Architecture & Design Decisions

**Why Next.js + FastAPI?**
- Next.js for modern React with SSR capabilities
- FastAPI for high-performance Python API
- Separation allows independent scaling
- TypeScript on frontend for type safety
- Python backend leverages ML libraries

**Why this folder structure?**
- App Router for modern Next.js patterns
- Component separation for reusability
- Backend isolation for clear API boundary
- Types directory for shared TypeScript definitions

### Algorithm & AI

**Mock LLM Approach**
- TF-IDF vectorization converts text to numbers
- Cosine similarity measures text relevance
- Multi-factor scoring (budget + amenities + needs)
- Weighted average: 30% + 40% + 30%

**Why these specific weights?**
- Amenities (40%): Most concrete user requirement
- Custom needs (30%): Important but subjective
- Budget (30%): Binary filter + optimization

**Scoring Formula**
```python
score = (
    budget_match_score * 0.3 +
    amenity_overlap_score * 0.4 +
    text_similarity_score * 0.3
)
```

### Data & Scaling

**Current (JSON file)**
- Pros: Simple, no database setup needed
- Cons: Not scalable, no persistence
- Good for: Demo, interview, proof of concept

**Production Migration**
- PostgreSQL for relational property data
- Redis for caching TF-IDF vectors
- S3 for property images
- Real LLM API (Claude/Gemini) for better matching

**Scaling to 10,000+ properties**
1. Pre-compute and cache TF-IDF vectors
2. Use vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate)
3. Implement pagination
4. Add search filters before matching
5. Consider clustering for faster similarity search

## üó£Ô∏è Interview Questions & Answers

### Q: Why did you choose this tech stack?

**A**: "I chose Next.js 14 for its modern App Router, excellent developer experience, and built-in API routes. React with TypeScript provides type safety and component reusability. For the backend, FastAPI offers high performance, automatic API documentation, and great Python ecosystem integration for ML libraries like scikit-learn. The separation allows each layer to be optimized and scaled independently."

### Q: How does your matching algorithm work?

**A**: "The algorithm uses a three-factor scoring system. First, budget matching scores properties based on how well they fit within the user's budget, with properties at 70-90% of budget scoring highest. Second, amenity scoring calculates the percentage overlap of desired features. Third, for custom needs, I use TF-IDF vectorization to convert property descriptions and user requirements into numerical vectors, then compute cosine similarity to find semantic matches. These three scores are weighted 30%, 40%, and 30% respectively to produce a final match score."

### Q: How would you integrate a real LLM API?

**A**: "I would replace the mock matching logic with API calls to Claude or Gemini. The LLM would receive the property data and user preferences, then generate both match scores and natural language explanations. I'd implement caching to reduce API costs, rate limiting to prevent abuse, and fallback logic to the current algorithm if the API is unavailable. The modular structure makes this swap straightforward - just modify the matcher.py file."

### Q: What about production security?

**A**: "Key security measures include: input validation with Pydantic on the backend, rate limiting on API endpoints, CORS properly configured for only allowed origins, environment variables for sensitive data, TypeScript for type safety, and proper error handling that doesn't expose internal details. For production, I'd add authentication, HTTPS enforcement, API key management, and potentially a WAF."

### Q: How would you handle 100,000 properties?

**A**: "At that scale, I'd implement several optimizations: pre-compute TF-IDF vectors and store in a vector database, add filtering before similarity search to reduce candidates, implement pagination for results, use caching (Redis) for common queries, consider approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms, and potentially pre-cluster properties to speed up searches. The architecture already supports these additions without major refactoring."

### Q: Walk me through the user flow

**A**: "User opens the app and sees a clean form. They select property type, enter budget, choose amenities via toggleable chips, and optionally add custom needs. On submit, the form validates inputs, shows a loading state, and calls the Next.js API route. This proxies to FastAPI which loads property data, runs the matching algorithm, generates explanations, and returns top 3 matches. Results display in cards showing match percentage, property details, and AI-generated reasoning. Users can contact an agent directly from each card."

### Q: What challenges did you face?

**A**: "The main challenge was balancing the scoring weights to produce meaningful results. Too much weight on budget made expensive properties never match. Too much on amenities ignored unique user needs. I tested multiple configurations and found 30/40/30 provides the best balance. Another challenge was making the AI explanations feel natural and specific rather than generic templates. I solved this with conditional logic that identifies specific matching factors."

### Q: How is this different from a keyword search?

**A**: "Traditional keyword search only finds exact text matches. This uses TF-IDF to understand term importance and cosine similarity to capture semantic meaning. For example, if a user searches for 'family-friendly', it will match properties mentioning 'near good schools', 'large backyard', or 'playground' even without the exact phrase. The multi-factor scoring also considers budget compatibility and amenity preferences, providing holistic matches rather than just text overlap."
