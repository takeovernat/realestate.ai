# AI Property Matchmaker - Project Summary

## Overview
A full-stack AI-powered property matching application built for real estate companies focused on master-planned communities. The app intelligently matches users with properties based on their preferences using a sophisticated scoring algorithm.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14** with App Router
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- Client-side form handling with React hooks

### Backend
- **FastAPI** (Python 3.9+)
- **Scikit-learn** for text similarity (TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity)
- **NumPy** for numerical computations
- RESTful API design

### Data
- JSON-based mock database with 10 sample properties
- Structured property data with amenities, pricing, and descriptions

## Key Features

### 1. Smart Property Matching
- Multi-factor scoring algorithm combining:
  - **Budget Matching (30%)**: Optimal price point scoring
  - **Amenity Overlap (40%)**: Percentage of desired features present
  - **Custom Needs (30%)**: Text similarity using NLP

### 2. AI Explanation Generation
- Natural language explanations for each match
- Template-based generation simulating LLM output
- Contextual reasons based on user preferences

### 3. User Experience
- Clean, intuitive form interface
- Real-time loading states
- Responsive card-based results display
- Match percentage badges
- Professional real estate aesthetic

### 4. Production-Ready Code
- TypeScript for type safety
- Comprehensive error handling
- CORS configuration
- Modular component architecture
- Clean code with comments

## Algorithm Details

### Scoring System
The mock AI uses a weighted scoring algorithm:

```python
Final Score = (Budget Score × 0.3) + (Amenity Score × 0.4) + (Custom Needs × 0.3)
```

#### Budget Scoring
- Properties at 70-90% of budget score highest (1.0)
- Below 70%: Scaled score (0.7-1.0)
- Above 90%: Slight penalty

#### Amenity Scoring
- Direct overlap percentage
- Bonus points for extra amenities
- Maximum score: 1.0

#### Custom Needs Scoring
- TF-IDF vectorization of property descriptions
- Cosine similarity between user needs and property features
- Captures semantic meaning, not just keyword matching

### Text Processing
1. Property descriptions converted to TF-IDF vectors
2. User custom needs vectorized using same model
3. Cosine similarity calculated
4. Results ranked by composite score

## API Endpoints

### POST /match
Matches properties based on user preferences.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "homeType": "single-family",
  "budget": 500000,
  "amenities": ["pool", "park"],
  "customNeeds": "Need home office and large backyard"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "matches": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Lakeside Villa",
      "type": "single-family",
      "price": 650000,
      "score": 0.876,
      "explanation": "This home well below your budget at $650,000, includes your desired amenities: pool, park, lake, matches your needs: spacious backyard."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Sample Data
10 diverse properties including:
- Single-family homes ($285K - $895K)
- Condos ($275K - $780K)
- Townhouses ($425K)
- Various amenities: pools, parks, gyms, golf courses
- Different locations within the community

## Time to Complete
- **Setup**: 10 minutes
- **Development**: 6-8 hours for mid-level developer
- **Total**: Completable in one working day

## Interview Highlights

### Technical Skills Demonstrated
✅ Full-stack development (Frontend + Backend)  
✅ Modern React with TypeScript  
✅ RESTful API design and implementation  
✅ Machine learning concepts (NLP, similarity)  
✅ Clean code architecture  
✅ Production deployment knowledge  
✅ Error handling and edge cases  
✅ Responsive UI/UX design  

### Real Estate Context
- Master-planned community focus
- Professional UI aesthetics
- Practical property matching logic
- Scalable architecture for growth

## Next Steps / Extensions
Potential improvements for discussion:
1. Real LLM integration (Claude/Gemini API)
2. Database migration (PostgreSQL)
3. User authentication
4. Saved searches and favorites
5. Interactive map integration
6. Agent contact form with email
7. Property image uploads
8. Advanced filtering options
9. A/B testing for match algorithms
10. Analytics dashboard

## Testing the Application

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Budget Filtering**: Enter low budget, verify expensive homes excluded
2. **Amenity Matching**: Select multiple amenities, check overlap scoring
3. **Custom Needs**: Enter "home office", verify properties with offices score higher
4. **No Matches**: Enter unrealistic criteria, check error handling
5. **Type Filtering**: Select "condo", verify only condos returned

### API Testing
```bash
# Test match endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/match \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"homeType":"any","budget":1000000,"amenities":["pool"],"customNeeds":"luxury"}'

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

## Performance Considerations
- TF-IDF vectorization: O(n) for n properties
- Cosine similarity: O(1) per comparison
- Top-3 selection: O(n log n) sorting
- Total: Fast enough for 100s of properties
- For 1000s of properties: Consider caching vectors

## Documentation Quality
- Comprehensive README with setup instructions
- Quick start guide for rapid deployment
- Deployment guide for multiple platforms
- Inline code comments explaining logic
- Type definitions for all data structures

## Accessibility & UX
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Loading states for async operations
- Error messages for edge cases
- Visual feedback (hover effects, active states)
- Semantic HTML structure
- Color contrast for readability
